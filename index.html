<h2>1. Clarity Before Kickoff</h2>
<p>Before you even schedule the strategy sprint, define your business goals for the next 6 to 12 months.</p>

<h2>2. Align on Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Who owns the final call on your end</li>
  <li>How often feedback will be shared</li>
  <li>What timelines are fixed and where flexibility exists</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Structure Feedback Around Strategy</h2>
<p>Always refer back to the north star. Avoid taste based feedback unless it breaks comprehension.</p>

<h2>4. Create Space for Creative Flow</h2>
<p>Block feedback windows in advance and avoid surprise escalations.</p>

<h2>5. Treat the Brand as a System</h2>
<p>You are not just making a logo. You are installing a company wide system.</p>
