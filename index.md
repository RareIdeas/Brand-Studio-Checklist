1. Clarity Before Kickoff
Before you even schedule the strategy sprint:
   Define your business goals for the next 6–12 months

2. Align on Roles & Responsibilities
   A great project begins when both sides are clear on:
   Who owns the final call on your end
   How often feedback will be shared (and in what format)
   What timelines are fixed, and where flexibility exists

3. Structure Your Feedback Around Strategy
   The biggest source of chaos? Feedback rooted in taste instead of alignment.
Use these rules:
   Always refer back to the North Star: “Does this still serve our strategy?”
   Avoid design tweaks like “move this left” unless it breaks comprehension

4. Create Space for Creative Flow
You’ll get better work when you:
   Block feedback review windows in advance
   Avoid surprise escalations or 24-hour turnaround asks

5. Treat the Brand as a Company System
You’re not just making a deck or a logo. You’re installing a system:
   That your marketing, sales, and HR teams will use daily
   That your investors will reference in every pitch
